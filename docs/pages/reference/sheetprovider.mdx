# SheetProvider props

`SheetProvider` wraps your app and is responsible for rendering all the action sheets.

Props:

## `context`

When you want to show action sheet from a modal, you must create a new `SheetProvider` inside the modal with a unique context id. Than you have to register the action sheet you want to show with that context id.

```ts
// Normal action sheet that is used with the global sheet provider.
registerSheet('example-sheet', ExampleSheet)
// You can also register the action sheet with multiple sheet providers.
registerSheet(
  'example-sheet-nested',
  ExampleSheet,
  'global',
  'local',
  'local-local'
)
```

<Callout>
  Registering an action sheet multiple times with a differnet context is
  completely normal. At idle no action sheets are kept in the render tree hence
  registering multiple times has no overhead in terms of performance or memory.

  Using the `SheetProvider` is optional. However it is the recommended way to
  handle action sheets in your app.
