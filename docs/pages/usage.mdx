# Basic usage

Import `ActionSheet`.

```tsx
import ActionSheet from "rn-sheet";
```

Then create your ActionSheet inside any component and attach a `ref` to it.

```tsx
function App() {
  const actionSheetRef = useRef<ActionSheetRef>(null);

  return (
    <ActionSheet ref={actionSheetRef}>
      <Text>Hi, I am here.</Text>
    </ActionSheet>
  );
}
```

Present the ActionSheet by calling `show` method on the ref.

```ts
actionSheetRef.current?.show();
```

And hide it by calling `hide` method on the ref.

```ts
actionSheetRef.current?.hide();
```

<Callout
  type="warning"
>
  While the above is fully functional it's not scalable when you have many
  ActionSheets in the app, it is recommended that you implement ActionSheets in
  your app using [Sheet Manager](/guides/sheetmanager) for more scalability.
