# `Scrolling`

Using `ScrollView` or `FlatList` inside a action sheet can become tricky because you have to handle gestures along with scrolling at the same time. You can import `ScrollView` and `FlatList` from the library to have scrolling and gestures work nicely together.

```tsx
import ActionSheet, { ScrollView, FlatList } from 'rn-sheet'

const ExampleSheet = () => {
  return (
    <ActionSheet>
      <ScrollView />
    </ActionSheet>
  )
}
```

## Scrolling with other Scrollable components

If you have a scrollable component such as WebView or a DatePicker, you can use the `useScrollHandlers` hook and `NativeViewGestureHandler` to enable scrolling inside the View.

```tsx
import { ScrollView } from 'react-native'
import ActionSheet, { useScrollHandlers } from 'rn-sheet'
import { NativeViewGestureHandler } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

const Sheet = () => {
  const handlers = useScrollHandlers()
  return (
    <ActionSheet>
      <NativeViewGestureHandler
        simultaneousHandlers={handlers.simultaneousHandlers}
      >
        <ScrollView {...handlers}></ScrollView>
      </NativeViewGestureHandler>
    </ActionSheet>
  )
}
```
