# Position tracking

Sometimes you need to track the position of the action sheet on the Screen & show/hide some UI in the background or inside the action sheet.This can be done using the `onChange` prop.

```tsx
<ActionSheet
  onChange={(position, height) => {
    // Position is 0 if action sheet has reached top.
    const hasReachedTop = position === 0
    // Get the offset from bottom
    const offsetFromBottom = height - position
  }}
/>
```
